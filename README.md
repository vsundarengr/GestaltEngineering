GESTALT (Guiding Engineering Success Through Adaptive Learning Technology) is a software technology platform that facilitates rapid deployment of educational content such as presentations, videos and static documents along with adaptive quizzes that can be designed to explore the complex problems that are typical in engineering. 

Development of GESTALT was made possible by a grant funded by the California Educational Learning Lab.
