        The car starts from rest, meaning its initial velocity (\(u\)) is 0. The final velocity (\(v\)) is given as {params.v} {params.unitsSpeed}, and the time (\(t\)) taken for acceleration is {params.t} {params.unitsTime}.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
        Since the car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly, the distance (\(d\)) can be calculated using the formula \(d = \frac{1}{2}vt\), where \(v\) is the final velocity and \(t\) is the time.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        Substitute the given values of \(v\) and \(t\) into the formula to calculate the distance: \(d = \frac{1}{2} \times {params.v} \times {params.t} = {correct_answers.d} {params.unitsDistance}\).
