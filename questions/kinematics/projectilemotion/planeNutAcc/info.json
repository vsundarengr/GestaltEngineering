When the plane is 1600 ft off the ground, a loose nut detaches from the plane and falls to the ground. Neglect air resistance and assume that the plane travels in a straight line at constant speed. Approximately, how high will the nut rise from its point of detachment before it begins to fall to the ground?", "topic": "Physics", "tags": ["kinematics", "projectile motion", "physics"], "prereqs": ["basic understanding of kinematics and projectile motion"], "isAdaptive": "true", "createdBy": "lberm007@ucr.edu", "qType": "num", "nSteps": 1, "updatedBy": "", "dificulty": 1, "codelang": "javascript"}
