        The problem involves calculating the horizontal distance a car travels after driving off a cliff with an upward slope of {{params.angle}} degrees. The car becomes airborne at a height of {{params.H}} {{params.unitsDist}} above the ocean, traveling at {{params.v}} {{params.unitsSpeed}}. The goal is to determine the distance from the coast where the car will impact the water.

    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
        Known Variables:
        - Initial velocity \( V_c = {{params.v}} \) {{params.unitsSpeed}}.
        - Slope angle \( \theta = {{params.angle}}^\circ \).
        - Cliff height \( h = {{params.H}} \) {{params.unitsDist}}.
        - Gravity \( g = 9.8 \) m/s\(^2\) or \( 32.2 \) ft/s\(^2\) depending on the unit system.

    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        Conversion and Equation Setup:
        1. For SI units: Convert velocity to m/s: \( V_c = {{params.v}} \times \frac{1000}{3600} \).
        2. For USCS units: Convert velocity to ft/s: \( V_c = {{params.v}} \times \frac{5280}{3600} \).
        3. Decompose \( V_c \) into horizontal (\( V_{cx} \)) and vertical (\( V_{cy} \)) components:
           - \( V_{cx} = V_c \cos(\theta) \)
           - \( V_{cy} = V_c \sin(\theta) \)

        Calculating Distance:
        1. Use the vertical motion equation to find flight time \( t \) by solving \( -\frac{1}{2} g t^2 + V_{cy} t - h = 0 \).
        2. With \( t \), compute horizontal distance \( \Delta x = V_{cx} t \).

        Analysis:
        - The car's trajectory is analyzed by separating its motion into horizontal and vertical components.
        - The time of flight, \( t \), influences the horizontal distance, requiring precise calculation from vertical motion parameters.
        - The quadratic equation used is derived from kinematic equations for vertical displacement and velocity.
