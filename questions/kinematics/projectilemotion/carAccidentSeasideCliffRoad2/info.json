    "title": "Car Accident on Seaside Cliff Road",
    "stem": "A car is traveling along a road winding around sea-side cliffs (like Highway 1 between Carmel and San Luis Obispo) at 54 kmph. The road has an upward slope of 5Â° to the horizontal. On a particularly sharp curve, the driver loses control, drives off the road and becomes air-borne. If the cliff is sheer so that it can be assumed to be vertical and is 40 m above the ocean below, approximately how far (in m) from the coast does the car hit the water?",
