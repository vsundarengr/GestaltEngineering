  <p> A car is traveling along a road winding around sea-side cliffs (like Highway 1 between Carmel and San Luis Obispo) at {{params.v}} {{params.unitsSpeed}}. The road has an upward slope of {{params.angle}}Â° to the horizontal. On a particularly sharp curve, the driver loses control, drives off the road and becomes air-borne.  </p>

If the cliff is sheer so that it can be assumed to be vertical and is {{params.H}} {{params.unitsDist}} above the ocean below, approximately how far (in {{params.unitsDist}}) from the coast does the car hit the water?

With what speed does the car (in {{params.unitsSpeed}}) hit the water?
