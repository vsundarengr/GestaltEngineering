  <p> A plane has taken off the runway and has gained a constant speed of {{params.v}} {{params.unitsSpeed}} making an angle {{params.theta}} degrees with the horizontal. When the plane is {{params.H}} {{params.unitsDist}} off the ground, a loose nut detaches from the plane and falls to the ground. Neglect air resistance and assume that the plane travels in a straight line at constant speed. </p>
  
</pl-question-panel>

<p> Approximately, how high will the nut rise from its point of detachment before it begins to fall to the ground? </p>
