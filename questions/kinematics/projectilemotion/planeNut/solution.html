        In this problem, we calculate the maximum height reached by a nut detaching from a plane mid-flight. The plane flies at a speed of <em>{{params.v}} {{params.unitsSpeed}}</em> and an ascent angle of <em>{{params.theta}} degrees</em> above the horizontal. We ignore air resistance and assume the nut moves straight at a constant speed before descending.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
        The initial velocity \( v_0 = {{params.v}} \) {{params.unitsSpeed}} at an angle \(\theta = {{params.theta}}\) degrees provides the setup. Gravity acts downward with an acceleration of \( a = -{{params.unitsAcc}} \).
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        To find the maximum height, we use:
        1. The vertical component of initial velocity: \(v_{0y} = v_0 \sin(\theta)\).
        2. The change in height: \(\Delta y = \frac{-v_{0y}^2}{2a}\), since at the apex, the vertical velocity \(v_{fy} = 0\).
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">
        The maximum height is directly obtained from \(\Delta y\), without needing to add it to the initial height, reflecting the nut's peak altitude from its detachment point.

        This approach uses kinematic equations and trigonometry to dissect the projectile motion, emphasizing gravity's role in shaping the trajectory.

        The maximum height reached by the nut, applying these principles, is <strong>{{correct_answers.h}} {{params.unitsDist}}</strong>.
