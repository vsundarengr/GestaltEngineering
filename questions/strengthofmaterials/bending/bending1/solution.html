    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">First you want to compute the reaction forces at A and B. The first step in doing so is to convert the distributed load into one force concentrated at its centroid.
        <p>We can compute the magnitude of the net force of the distributed force to be $F(L)$. The centroid is simply $\frac{L}{2}$</p>
        <p>Now that you have the magnitude of the force and the location, you can compute the reaction forces.</p>
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
                In order to compute the reaction forces you have to set up your equilibrium equations.
                <li>$\Sigma{F}_y = A_y+B_y-F(L) = 0$</li>
                <li>$\Sigma{M}_A = B_y (L) - F(L)(\frac{L}{2}) =0$</li>
                <p>Solving for the reaction forces we get: </p>
                <li>$B_y = \frac{F(L)}{2} = {{correct_answers.reactionB}} ~kN$</li>
                <li>$A_y = F(L)-B_y =  {{correct_answers.reactionA}} ~kN $</li>
         <p>With all of the forces acting on the beam you can draw the shear force and moment diagram. You can use the moment diagram to find your max moment.</p>
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        <ul>
          The max moment is the area under the shear force curve of the positive half.
          <li>Max moment = $\frac{A_y(\frac{L}{2})}{2} =  {{correct_answers.maxM}}$ kN*m</li>
          <p>Moving on to finding the moment of inertia: I = $\Sigma(\bar{I}+Ad^2)$</p>
          Where $\bar{I} = \frac{1}{12}b(h^3) $ and d = distance from sub shape centroid to central axis.
        </ul>
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">
        <ul>
        <p>Solving for Inertia:</p>
        <li> $\bar{I}+Ad^2$ for the bottom and top rectangle: $2[\frac{1}{12}(L_2)(L_3)^3 + (L_2)(L_3)(\frac{L_1}{2}+\frac{L_3}{2})^2]$ </li>
        We can just compute $\bar{I}+Ad^2$ as if we are only doing it for the top rectangle, then multiply it by 2 since the top and bottom rectangles are geometrically the same.
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>$\bar{I}+Ad^2$ for the middle rectangle : $[\frac{1}{12}(L_3)(L_1)^3]$</li>
        We do not need to compute $Ad^2$ for the center rectangle since the centroid of the center rectangle = central axis, so the distance between the centroid of the center rectangle and the central axis will be d = 0
        <p>We can now add up the moment of inertia of the sub-shapes to get:</p>
        <li>I = $\Sigma(\bar{I}+Ad^2)$ = $2[\frac{1}{12}(L_2)(L_3)^3 + (L_2)(L_3)(\frac{L_1}{2}+\frac{L_3}{2})^2]$ +  $[\frac{1}{12}(L_3)(L_1)^3] =  {{correct_answers.I}} ~ \mu m^4$</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
                Lastly, you can compute the Max bending stress as :$ \frac{M ~C}{I}$, where C is the distance you want to calculate the bending stress.
                <p>In our case C is the distance from the center to the edge, so that will be $\frac{L_1}{2}+L_3$ </p>
                <li>$\sigma_{max} = \frac{M ~C}{I} = {{correct_answers.stress}}$ Mpa</li>
        </ul>
