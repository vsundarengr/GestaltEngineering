    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">Draw a free-body diagram of the beam after it has made contact with the wall. And compute the normal force at A.  </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">Drawing the free body diagram of the bream and doing $\Sigma{F}_x$, you can compute that the normal force at A is $N_A = F-N_B$.
<p>Knowing that the max length the beam could extend, create a second equation that models the net change in length.</p>

        <ul>
            Equations:
            <li>$N_A = F-N_B$</li>
            <li>$\frac{N_A~L_1}{A~E}+\frac{N_B~L_2}{A~E}= L_3  $</li>
            With these two equations, we can solve for the normal force at B ($N_B$).

       <p>Plugging in $N_A = F-N_B$ into $\frac{N_A~L_1}{A~E}+\frac{N_B~L_2}{A~E}= L_3 $, you can solve for the $N_B$
