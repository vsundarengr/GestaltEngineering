  <p> A {{params.object}} of {{params.radius}} {{params.unitsdist}} is rotating {{params.direction}} about an axle at an angular speed of {{params.angspeed}} {{params.unitsangspeed}}. What is the magnitude of the velocity (in {{correct_answers_labels.unitsvel}}) of a point that is located at a distance {{params.rad}} {{params.unitsdist}} from the center along a ray that makes an angle {{params.angle}} degrees with the horizontal? </p>
