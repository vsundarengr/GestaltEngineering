    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">This problem involves analyzing the forces acting on each mass and applying Newton's second law to the system as a whole. The forces include gravitational force, normal force, and frictional force where applicable.</pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">Known Variables:
        <ul>
            <li>Masses: \( m_A = {{params.mA}} \text{{kg}} \), \( m_B = {{params.mB}} \text{{kg}} \), \( m_C = {{params.mC}} \text{{kg}} \)</li>
            <li>Angles: \( \theta = {{params.theta}}^\circ \), \( \phi = {{params.phi}}^\circ \)</li>
            <li>Coefficients of friction: \( \mu_s = {{params.mu_s}} \) (static), \( \mu_k = {{params.mu_k}} \) (kinetic)</li>
        </ul>
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">Equation Setup:
        The net force on the system can be described by Newton's second law:
        \[ F_{{\text{{net}}}} = m_{{\text{{T}}}}a \]
        where \( m_{{\text{{T}}}} \) is the total mass and \( a \) is the acceleration.
        The forces acting on each mass are:
        <ul>
            <li>For \( m_A \): \( m_A g \sin(\theta) \)</li>
            <li>For \( m_B \): \( m_B g \)</li>
            <li>For \( m_C \): \( m_C g \sin(\phi) \) and friction \( f_k = \mu_k m_C g \cos(\phi) \)</li>
        </ul>
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">Solution Process:
        1. Write down the forces acting on each mass due to gravity and friction.
        2. Set up the equation for the net force using Newton's second law.
        3. Solve for the acceleration \( a \).
        \[ F_{{\text{{net}}}} = m_B g + m_A g \sin(\theta) - m_C g \sin(\phi) - \mu_k m_C g \cos(\phi) \]
        And the acceleration \( a \) is given by:
        \[ a = \frac{{{{correct_answers.acceleration}}}}{{m_{{\text{{T}}}}}} \]
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="5" data-type="text">Explanation and Clarification:
        The equation for \( F_{{\text{{net}}}} \) takes into account the gravitational force component along the incline for \( m_A \) and \( m_C \), the gravitational force acting on \( m_B \), and the kinetic friction force opposing the motion of \( m_C \). The total mass \( m_{{\text{{T}}}} \) is the sum of all three masses. The acceleration \( a \) is the net force divided by the total mass, calculated as \( a = {{correct_answers.acceleration}} \, {{params.unitsAcc}} \).

    <pl-hint level="6" data-type="text">Educational Goal:
        The guide aims to help understand the application of Newton's second law in a system with multiple masses connected by a string over a pulley, considering different forces such as gravity and friction. It emphasizes the importance of breaking down forces into components and combining them to find the net force and resulting acceleration.
