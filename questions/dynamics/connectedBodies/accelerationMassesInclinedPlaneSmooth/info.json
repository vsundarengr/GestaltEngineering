  "stem": "The figure shows three masses mA = 1kg, mB = 3kg and mC = 2kg on a inclined plane as shown. The surface on which A and B is frictionless while the coefficients of static and kinetic friction between C and the surface is 0.35 and 0.3 respectively. The pulley is massless and frictionless. The angles are θ = 60° and ϕ = 30°.",
