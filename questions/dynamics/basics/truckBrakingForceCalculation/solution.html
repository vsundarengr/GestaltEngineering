        <p>Let's solve this problem step by step, focusing on the principles of physics, particularly Newton's second law (\(F=ma\)) and kinematic equations, to find out the initial speed of the truck. </p>
    </div>

    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">
        <p>First, understand that the <strong>initial speed of the truck</strong> can be approached by considering the braking force applied to bring it to a stop. This situation is a direct application of <strong>Newton's second law</strong> and kinematic equations.</p>
    </pl-hint>
    
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
        <p>Newton's second law (\(F=ma\)) relates the force applied to an object, its mass, and the acceleration it undergoes. Here, the braking force (\(F\)) produces a deceleration (\(a\)) that slows the truck down from its initial speed (\(v_i\)) to a halt (\(v_f = 0\)).</p>
    </pl-hint>
    
    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        <p>To calculate the deceleration, we rearrange Newton's second law to \(a = \frac{F}{m}\), where \(m\) is the mass of the truck </p>
    </pl-hint>
    
    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">
        <p>Using the kinematic equation \(v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad\), where \(d\) is the distance over which the deceleration occurs, and solving for the initial speed (\(v_i\)), we get \(v_i = \sqrt{v_f^2 - 2ad}\). Substituting \(v_f = 0\) simplifies our equation to \(v_i = \sqrt{-2ad}\), allowing us to calculate the initial speed directly from the force applied, the distance, and the truck's mass.</p>
    </pl-hint>
    
    <pl-hint level="5" data-type="text">
    <p>After determining the initial speed in m/s (for SI) or ft/s (for USCS), we convert this speed into the unit system's standard speed unit (km/h for SI or mph for USCS)  Thus, the initial speed of the truck, is <strong>\(v = {{correct_answers.v}}\) {{params.unitspeed}}</strong>.</p>
