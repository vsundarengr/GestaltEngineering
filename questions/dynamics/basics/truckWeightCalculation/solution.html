    <!-- Step 1: Understanding the Problem -->
    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">
        <strong>Understanding the Formula:</strong> The weight of the truck can be calculated using the formula: \( W = \frac{F \times d}{v^2} \), where \( F \) is the braking force in newtons, \( d \) is the distance in meters, and \( v \) is the speed in meters per second. This formula helps in understanding how the weight influences braking efficiency.

    <!-- Step 2: Substituting the Values -->
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="formula">
        <p><strong>Substitute the Given Values:</strong> To find the weight, weâ€™ll insert our specific values into the formula. Therefore, we compute \( W = \frac{{{params.force}} \times {{params.distance}}}{{{params.speed}}^2} \). It is crucial to ensure all units are consistent for accurate calculations (e.g., if force is given in kilonewtons, convert it to newtons).</p>

    <!-- Final Step: Showing the Correct Answer -->
    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="result">
        <strong>Final Calculation:</strong> Based on the substituted values, the weight of the truck is calculated to be \( m = {{correct_answers.w}} {{params.unitsWeight}} \). This result consolidates our understanding and application of the formula in practical scenarios.
