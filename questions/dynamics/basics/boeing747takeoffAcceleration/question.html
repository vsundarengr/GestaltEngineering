  <p> A Boeing 747 has a take-off weight of {{params.weight}} {{params.unitsWeight}} and has 4 engines that each generate a maximum thrust of {{params.thrust}} {{params.unitsThrust}}. </p>
  <p> If the plane is to start from rest and accelerate to a take-off speed of {{params.speed}} {{params.unitsSpeed}} and all 4 engines are operating at {{params.percentage}}% of their maximum thrust, how long (in {{params.unitsTime}}) does it take for the plane to accelerate from rest to take-off? </p>
