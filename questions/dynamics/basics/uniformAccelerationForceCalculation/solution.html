        To begin solving this problem, let's understand that the force required to uniformly accelerate a vehicle can be calculated using Newton's second law: \( F = ma \), where \( m \) represents the mass of the vehicle, and \( a \) is its acceleration.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
        Next, to find the acceleration \( a \), we use the equation: \( a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} \). Here, \( v_f \) is the vehicle's final velocity, \( v_i \) is its initial velocity (assuming the vehicle starts from rest, \( v_i = 0 \)), and \( t \) is the time taken to reach \( v_f \) from \( v_i \).

        Let's insert the given values into our formulas. For acceleration, we calculate: \( a = \frac{{params.vd} - 0}{{params.t}} \), which simplifies to \( a = \frac{{params.vd}}{{params.t}} \). Given the mass (\( m = {params.md} {params.unitsMass} \)) of the vehicle, we can now compute the force: \( F = {params.md} \times a \).

    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">
        With the computed acceleration, and knowing the vehicle's mass, we find that the force required to uniformly accelerate the vehicle to its final velocity \( {params.vd} {params.unitsSpeed} \) in \( {params.t} {params.unitsTime} \) is precisely \( F = {correct_answers.F} {params.unitsForce} \). This provides us with a clear understanding of the dynamics involved in accelerating the vehicle under the given conditions.

        Review this example carefully to grasp how the formulas connect and how changing any of the variables (mass, time, or velocity) would affect the required force. This understanding is crucial for solving similar problems in physics and engineering disciplines.
