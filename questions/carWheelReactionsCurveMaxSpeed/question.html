  <p> A car of {{params.md}} {{params.unitsMass}} {{params.masslabel}} is traveling along on a level road.  </p>
  <p> The road curves with a radius of {{params.R}} {{params.unitsDist}} </p>
  <p> The distance between the inner and the outer wheels is {{params.B}} {{params.unitsCarDim}}.</p>
  <p> The center of mass is between the inner and outer wheels. The center of mass is at a height {{params.h}} {{params.unitsCarDim}} from the ground.</p>
  <p> What is the maximum speed (in {{params.unitsSpeed}}) before the car rolls over? </p>
