  The figure shows two blocks 1 and 2 connected by a cable. The {{params.masslabel}} of block 1 is {{params.m1}} {{params.unitsMass}} while the {{params.masslabel}} of block 2 is {{params.m2}} {{params.unitsMass}}.  The coefficients of static and kinetic friction between block 1 and the surface are respectively {{params.mus}} and {{params.muk}}.

<p>
  What's the work done (in {{params.unitsWork}}) by each of the forces acting on the two blocks when block 1 moves {{params.distance}} {{params.unitsDist}}  to the right? Include sign of the work.
