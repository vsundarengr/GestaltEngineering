    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">Draw a free body diagram on member CB and try and solve for the unkowns. </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">When drawing a free body diagram on member CB we can draw the reaction forces on point C as down and left for Cy and Cx. 
        Since member AB is a two force member we can draw the reaction force at point B as a single force point towards B and at an angle that follows a line from point A to B. 
        Lastly you can draw the tension forces causes by the pully and the weight. The tension points left and down coming from the pully.  </pl-hint>

                    Solving using member CB:


                    <p>Let $\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{2_1}{L_2}) $</p>

                    <li>$\Sigma{M}_C = 0 $ $\implies$ $B_rSin(\theta)L_2+ W(R) - W (L_2+L_3+R) = 0$</li>
                    <p> Solving for $B_R$ (the reaction force on point B) we get:</p>
                    <li>$B_R = \frac{W(L_2+L_3+R)-W(R)}{Sin(\theta)L_2}$</li>
                    


                    We can break the reaction force $B_R$ into $B_x$ and $B_y$:
                    <li>$B_x = cos(\theta)B_R$ </li>
                    <li>$B_y = sin(\theta)B_R$ </li>

                    Now you can try to solve for $C_x$ and $C_y$

                </ul>

        <ul>
            Solving for $C_x$ and $C_y$:
            <li>$\Sigma{F}_x = 0 $ $\implies$ $ B_x - C_x -W = 0$ $\implies$ $C_x = W-B_x$ </li>
            <li>$\Sigma{F}_y = 0 $ $\implies$ $ B_y - C_y -W = 0$ $\implies$ $C_y = W-B_y$ </li>
