    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text"> The first step is to break up the system into parts. Break off member CB and AB and draw free body diagrams for each member.</pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text"> Secondly we must solve for the force of the spring. Spring force is equal to $F_s = k(\Delta{x})$. In this case $\Delta{x}$ can by comparing the length of the spring we have now, and the unstretched length of the spring . </pl-hint>

                  <p>Free body diagram for member CB:</p>
                    <li>At pin C we can write Cx and Cy reaction forces as up and left, and at point B we can do the same for Bx and By.</li>
                    <li>We also have to draw the spring force pointing down from point C and we need to draw the weight force point down starting at the middle of the member.</li>
                  <p>Free body diagram for member AB:</p>
                    <li>At pin A we can write the reaction force Ax pointing left. There is no need for Ay since this is a rollar joint.</li>
                    <li>At pin B we have to write the reaction forces opposit to what we did last time so Bx and By are pointing down and right on member AB.</li>
                    <li>We also have to draw the spring force pointing up from pin A and we need to draw the weight force point down starting at the middle of the member.</li>
                    <p>Solving for spring force:</p>
                    <li>Using the equation $F_s = k(\Delta {x})$ we can simply just solve for $\Delta{x}$ since we are given k = {{params.k}}</li>
                    <li>Using trig we can find that the length of the spring is $2Lsin(\theta)$ and we are given the unstretched length of the spring so, $F_s = k(2Lsin(\theta)-{{params.ls}})$. </li>

                    Now you can use the free body diagrams to create three equations to solve for your three unknowns. ($\theta$ , $B_x$, $B_y$)
                </ul>

        <ul>
          <p>Creating three equations with out free body diagrams:</p>
          <li>Using member CB we can write a moment equation about point C.</li>

          <li>$\Sigma{M}_C = 0$ $\implies$ $-Wcos(\theta)\frac{L}{2}-Lsin(\theta)B_x+Lcos(\theta)B_y=0$</li>
             <p></p>
          <li>Using member AB we can write a moment equation about point A.</li>
          <li>$\Sigma{M}_A = 0$ $\implies$ $-Wcos(\theta)\frac{L}{2}-Lsin(\theta)B_x-Lcos(\theta)B_y=0$</li>
         <p></p>
        <li>Using member AB to write a force equation in the y direction:</li>
          <li>$\Sigma{F}_y = 0$ $\implies$ $F_s-W-B_y=0$</li>
        <p>Now you have three equations and three unkowns. You can solve for each varible.</p>
