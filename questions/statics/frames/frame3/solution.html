        Solving reaction forces:
        <li> Beam BF: $ \Sigma M_B = 0 \implies -(E_y)(L_2) - (W)(L_2+L_3+r)=0 \implies |E_y| = (W)(L_2+L_3+r)/-l_2 = {{correct_answers.DX}}$ ${{params.unitsForce}}$</li>

        <li>Note: The solutions want the magnitude of the forces which is why they all come out positve.</li>
        <li>When you get negative solutions for reaction forces, that indactes that you have to switch the force direction.</li>
        <li>For example: This is why when solving for $B_x$ it NOT $B_x = E_x + F_x$ even though that is technically correct with the way we initially drew the forces.</li>
        <li>It is beacuse the true direction of $E_x$ on beam BF is to the right (positive x direction) regardless of the direction of our initial guess. </li>
