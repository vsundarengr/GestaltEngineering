<p>The figure shows a box of weight W in the shape of a cube with sides of length a. It has a roller on one of its sides. The roller rests against a plane that makes an angle ( $ \theta = 50Â° $). The other side rests on a ground with coefficient of friction ( $ \mu  $). The figure also shows the free-body diagram of the box. Which of the following are true?
