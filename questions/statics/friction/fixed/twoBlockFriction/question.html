<p>The figure shows a block B of mass 10 kg resting on a block A of 15 kg that rests on the ground. Block B  is restrained by a string to the wall. The coefficient of friction between blocks A and B is 0.25 while the coefficient between A and the ground is 0.3.  A force P acts an angle 50 degrees on A. 
</p>
<p>
  The figure shows the free-body diagram of block B. Which of the following are true?
